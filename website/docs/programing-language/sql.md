# SQL

SQL, Structured Query Language, is designed to allow users to `query`, `manipulate`, and `transform` data from a **relational database**.

> ⚠️ There are many different SQL databases that support different features and storage types. Therefore, the SQL syntax on different databases may be slightly different.
